#css #ResponsiveDesign
This is a project I did while learning more about responsive web design. I worked on the css code in order to ensure that the site's appearance is not compromised when used in a variety of devices.
Highlight:
Ensuring the use of media query = applying several media features to ensure that the website is responsive when viewed on different screen devices.
